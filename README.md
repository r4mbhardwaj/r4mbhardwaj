Hey there, it's Ram. Just your average friendly neighborhood coder. I juggle with bytes and try not to spill my coffee while doing it, btw.

I use Arch, Gentoo, Fedora, and Ubuntu, all at the same time, btw. Bet that gave your CPU a stroke! ðŸ˜‰ Check out [niyofetch](Link_to_your_niyofetch_repo) to understand what the hell that means.

So, here's my GitHub report card, btw:

![GitHub streak stats](https://github-readme-streak-stats-kappa-wine.vercel.app/?user=r4mbhardwaj&exclude_days=Sat)

Oh, and btw, feel free to connect on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/r4mbhardwaj/), btw.

Just casually reminding you to keep your curiosity high and your exceptions handled, cuz null pointers ain't gonna handle themselves, btw! 

Stack traces and chill,
~ Ram
